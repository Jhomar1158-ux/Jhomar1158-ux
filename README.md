### Team Projects :star:

- [Product Sorting System](https://github.com/Jhomar1158-ux/Proyecto-003)

  The development of this project allows us to apply concepts of microprocessors and microcontrollers for implementation in a product grouping system on a conveyor belt. For    this, computer vision libraries such as Tensor Flow and Open CV will be used, using Python as the base language. In this way, it seeks to achieve the objective of optimizing the classification of products and that it can be monitored on a screen using Flask.

  E-commerce of table games
  
- [iAforo](https://github.com/Jhomar1158-ux/iAforo-pruebas)

  Due to the current situation due to covid-19, it is required to limit the capacity for certain establishments in order to avoid crowding. Faced with this need, we created iAforo. An embedded system powered by solar panels capable of recording the exact number of people in a space through artificial vision, and then showing whether or not there is iAforo (there is capacity).
  
- [Izily](https://github.com/JoCGM09/Izily-React)

  A social network focused on connecting students and teachers through effective search systems, references from other users, and qualified experiences, maintaining a mainly   educational interaction between the inside and outside of class.

  Voice assistant at scale, integrated with an Artificial Intelligence, that provides truthful information on prevention and health promotion in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
- [Edullka](https://edullka.github.io/)

  Edullka Virtual Camps were born with the initiative to show the skills needed by students who are passionate about new technologies in the field of application.

  
- [Qurier App](https://github.com/Jhomar1158-ux/Somos-Qurier-App)
  
  It's an app that connects you with your environment to make purchases that will earn you extra money or request someone to make them for you.
  
- [Amachay App](https://github.com/Jhomar1158-ux/Project-Amachay)
  
  AMACHAY-COVID proposes a solution for the prevention of the contagion of COVID-19, alerting the presence and/or agglomeration of infected people in an approximate range of   100 meters around, through improved algorithms to identify the probably infected people, allowing them to monitor the contagion routes street by street, follow the route or   take another.
